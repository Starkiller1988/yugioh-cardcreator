# Yu-Gi-Oh! : Waking the Cards (Database and Card Creator)

Welcome to my Capstone Project which I programmed during my Fullstack Developer Bootcamp from 31.Jan - 26.Apr, 2022. Before that I visited another Bootcamp last year to become a Frontend Developer from Sep,6th - Nov,26th. 

The inspiration for this perticular Project came from my passion of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Series and the Trading Card Game. I always wanted to program a application where Users can create their own Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards, from creating already existing cards to new cards. The Fantasy is unlimited at this point.

What do you have to do to start? Follow the instructions:

1. Click on the Heroku link.

4. Congratulations, you successfully loged in and now you can start your journey through the application. You have the choise between:

# Card Database

A simple Database of all Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game Cards available on the market. This Component uses a filter to search for specific cards

# Card Creator

This is the heart of the Application. Here Users can let their fantasy play and create alreaty existing cards or create new cards. It is limited right now just for monster cards but in time Spell, Trap and Linked Monsters will be added.
