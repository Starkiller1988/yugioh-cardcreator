# Yu-Gi-Oh! : Waking the Cards (Database and Card Creator)

Welcome to my Capstone Project which I programmed during my Fullstack Developer Bootcamp from 31.Jan - 26.Apr, 2022. Before that I visited another Bootcamp last year to become a Frontend Developer from Sep,6th - Nov,26th. 

The inspiration for this perticular Project came from my passion of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Series and the Trading Card Game. I always wanted to program a application where Users can create their own Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards, from creating already existing cards to new cards. The Fantasy is unlimited at this point.
